# netv2-testhat

This circuit board is meant to be combined with
a Raspberry Pi to create the production tester for
NeTV2.

The circuit board is designed with a "break-away"
PCI express header that's meant to be plugged into
the NeTV2 Raspberry Pi riser, and then both card
edges are inserted simultaneously into the tester
hat board for the full sequence test.
